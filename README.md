# Learning R for data science during the zombie apocalypse

Interested in learning R for data science while hunkering down for a virus
outbreak, or while on break or vacation? Below are some links to resources where
you can learn more about R, statistics, and applying techniques to real world
problems.

## Textbooks

Textbooks are a classic way to brush up on your skills. These days many books can be read for free online and come with example code and data sets. Folks learning in their spare time can set chapter based goals rather than tacking the subject all at once.
